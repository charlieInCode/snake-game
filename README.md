# Project Brief: Snake Game Web App

## Executive Summary

**Project Concept**: A modern web-based implementation of the classic Snake game built with Next.js, featuring persistent leaderboard functionality and optimized for portfolio demonstration.

**Primary Problem**: Portfolio needs a full-stack web application that demonstrates modern React/Next.js skills, database integration, and clean user interface design through a familiar, engaging game format.

**Target Market**: Portfolio viewers (potential employers, clients, collaborators) and casual web game players who appreciate clean, responsive gameplay.

**Key Value Proposition**: Clean, modern implementation of a timeless game that showcases full-stack development capabilities while providing immediate, intuitive user engagement.

## Problem Statement

**Current State**: Portfolio lacks a comprehensive full-stack demonstration project that shows both frontend game logic implementation and backend data persistence capabilities.

**Pain Points Addressed**:

- Need for a project that demonstrates complex state management (game logic)
- Requirement for database integration showcase (persistent leaderboard)
- Desire for a project with immediate visual appeal and engagement
- Portfolio gap in interactive, real-time application development

**Impact**: A well-executed snake game demonstrates technical proficiency across the full stack while being immediately understandable and engaging to portfolio viewers.

**Why This Solution**: Snake game provides familiar gameplay that allows focus on technical implementation quality, while leaderboard feature demonstrates full-stack capabilities in a contained, manageable scope.

## Proposed Solution

**Core Concept**: Browser-based snake game with smooth controls, responsive design, and persistent high score tracking.

**Key Differentiators**:

- Modern Next.js implementation showcasing current best practices
- Clean, responsive UI that works across devices
- Persistent leaderboard demonstrating database integration
- Portfolio-quality code organization and documentation

**Technical Approach**:

- Frontend: Next.js with canvas-based game rendering
- Backend: API routes for score persistence
- Database: Simple storage solution for leaderboard data
- Deployment: Platform suitable for portfolio hosting

**Success Vision**: A polished, playable game that effectively demonstrates full-stack development skills while being genuinely enjoyable to play.

- **Persistence**: Leaderboard data saves and retrieves correctly

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)

- **Classic Snake Gameplay**: Arrow key/WASD controls, growing snake, food collection, collision detection
- **Game State Management**: Start, pause, game over, restart functionality
- **Score Tracking**: Real-time score display during gameplay
- **Persistent Leaderboard**: Top 3 high scores saved across browser sessions
- **Responsive Design**: Playable on desktop and mobile devices

### Out of Scope for MVP

- Multiplayer functionality
- Multiple game modes or difficulty levels
- User authentication or profiles
- Social sharing features
- Sound effects or background music
- Advanced graphics or animations beyond basic game rendering

### MVP Success Criteria

Game demonstrates complete full-stack functionality with clean, portfolio-quality implementation that loads quickly and plays smoothly across modern browsers.

## Post-MVP Vision

### Phase 2 Features

- Enhanced visual effects and animations
- Additional game modes (speed variants, obstacles)
- Sound effects and background music
- Local storage for player preferences

### Long-term Vision

Portfolio piece that consistently demonstrates technical capabilities and serves as conversation starter during technical interviews.

### Expansion Opportunities

Could serve as foundation for more complex gaming projects or real-time multiplayer implementations in future portfolio additions.

## Technical Considerations

### Platform Requirements

- **Target Platforms**: Modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Browser Support**: ES6+ compatible browsers
- **Performance Requirements**: 60fps gameplay, <3 second load time

### Technology Preferences

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+, React 18+, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS or CSS Modules for responsive design
- **Game Rendering**: HTML5 Canvas for optimal performance
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes for simplicity
- **Database**: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production (or simpler solution)
- **Hosting**: Vercel, Netlify, or similar platform

### Architecture Considerations

- **Repository Structure**: Monorepo with clear separation of game logic and UI components
- **State Management**: React useState/useEffect for game state, context if needed
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints for leaderboard operations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for database connectivity issues

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

- **Timeline**: Portfolio project timeline (flexible but should be completable)
- **Complexity**: Must remain simple enough for solo development
- **Resources**: Single developer, no budget for external services
- **Scope**: Limited to essential features for portfolio demonstration

### Key Assumptions

- Modern browser environment with JavaScript enabled
- Canvas API support available
- Network connectivity for leaderboard persistence
- Developer has intermediate React/Next.js experience

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

- **Performance**: Canvas rendering performance on lower-end devices
- **Scope Creep**: Temptation to add unnecessary features
- **Browser Compatibility**: Ensuring consistent experience across browsers
- **Mobile UX**: Touch controls implementation for mobile devices

### Open Questions

- Should mobile have touch controls or virtual buttons?
- What database solution provides best balance of simplicity and portfolio value?
- How sophisticated should the visual design be while maintaining focus on code quality?

### Areas Needing Further Research

- Optimal canvas implementation patterns for game performance
- Best practices for Next.js game state management
- Simple database solutions for hobby projects
