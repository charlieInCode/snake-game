## Goals

- [cite_start]Demonstrate full-stack development capabilities with a modern Next.js implementation. [cite: 1350]

## Background Context

This project addresses a gap in the current portfolio for a comprehensive application that is both technically robust and immediately engaging. The classic Snake game provides a familiar foundation, allowing the focus to remain on the quality of the technical implementation. The core challenge is to build a polished, performant, and responsive version of the game that also includes persistent high scores on the client-side, thereby proving proficiency in modern frontend development.
