# 3. User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The user experience should be immediate, intuitive, and clean. The primary goal is to create a frictionless "pick up and play" experience. The interface will be minimalist, ensuring the focus remains squarely on the game itself, while still feeling modern and polished.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Desktop**: Keyboard controls (Arrow keys/WASD).
- **Mobile**: Touch-based swipe gestures.

## Core Screens and Views

2.  **Game Screen**: Contains the game canvas, score display, and a "Pause" button.
3.  **Game Over Screen**: A modal displaying the final score, the updated leaderboard, and a "Restart" button.
