# 13. Security and Performance

### **Security Requirements**

- **XSS Prevention**: We will rely on React's native data binding and JSX syntax, which automatically sanitizes content to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Dependency Security**: The development process will include running `npm audit` regularly to identify and patch vulnerabilities.
- **Secure Headers**: Basic security headers will be applied automatically by Vercel during deployment.

### **Performance Optimization**

- **Bundle Size**: We will leverage Next.js's automatic code splitting to keep the initial JavaScript bundle small.
- **Loading Strategy**: The application will be statically rendered by Next.js, resulting in a highly optimized, fast-loading initial page.
- **Canvas Performance**: The game loop and rendering logic will be optimized to ensure minimal re-renders and efficient drawing on the canvas to maintain a smooth 60fps.
