# Performance Considerations

## Performance Goals

**Page Load:** Initial render complete within 2 seconds on standard broadband connections with game ready to play within 3 seconds total.

**Interaction Response:** All button clicks and keyboard inputs provide immediate visual feedback within 16ms (single frame at 60fps).

**Animation FPS:** Maintain consistent 60fps for all game animations and UI transitions without frame drops during gameplay.

## Design Strategies

**Optimize Canvas Rendering**: Use efficient drawing techniques with minimal canvas state changes and batch operations where possible. Implement dirty rectangle optimization for game element updates.

**Leverage Shadcn Performance**: Utilize Shadcn/ui's optimized component implementations and built-in performance best practices. Components designed for minimal re-renders and efficient DOM updates.

**Progressive Enhancement**: Core game functionality works without JavaScript animations. Enhanced interactions layer on top for browsers with full capabilities.

**Asset Optimization**: Minimal external assets with focus on web fonts and Shadcn icons. No unnecessary images or graphics that could impact load performance.

**Code Splitting Strategy**: Game logic and UI components organized for optimal Next.js automatic code splitting. Critical rendering path prioritized for immediate gameplay availability.
