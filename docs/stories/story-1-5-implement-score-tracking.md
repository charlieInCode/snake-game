**Status**: Complete  
**Epic**: Epic 1 - Foundational Gameplay & Core Mechanics  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Story Points**: 2

## Story

**As a** player,  
**I want** to see my score increase as I eat food,  
**so that** I have a clear goal and can track my progress.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The game starts with a score of 0.
2. The score is visibly displayed on the screen outside of the game canvas.
3. Each time the snake consumes a piece of food, the score increments by a fixed amount (e.g., 10 points).
4. The displayed score updates in real-time.

## Tasks

- [x] Create score state management

- [x] Create score display (integrated in main page)
- [x] Update food consumption to increment score

## Dev Notes

- Score display should be prominent and easy to read
- Consider adding score animation when it increases
- Score should be part of the game state object
