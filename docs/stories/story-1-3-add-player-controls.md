# Story 1.3: Add Player Controls

**Status**: Draft  
**Epic**: Epic 1 - Foundational Gameplay & Core Mechanics  
**Priority**: High  
**Story Points**: 3

## Story

**As a** player,  
**I want** to control the snake's direction using the keyboard,  
**so that** I can navigate the game board and interact with the game.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Pressing the Arrow Keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) or WASD keys changes the snake's direction of movement.
2. The snake cannot immediately reverse its direction (e.g., if moving right, the left key is ignored).
3. The control inputs are responsive and accurately reflected in the snake's next movement.

## Tasks

- [ ] Implement keyboard event handling
- [ ] Add direction change logic
- [ ] Prevent reverse direction movement
- [ ] Integrate controls with game state
- [ ] Test control responsiveness

## Subtasks

- [ ] Add keyboard event listeners in `GameBoard.tsx`
- [ ] Create direction validation in `lib/game-utils.ts`
- [ ] Update `useGameLogic.ts` to handle direction changes
- [ ] Add direction state to game state management
- [ ] Implement input buffering for responsive controls
- [ ] Add visual feedback for direction changes

## Dev Notes

- Support both Arrow Keys and WASD for accessibility
- Prevent 180-degree turns (snake can't reverse into itself)
- Use event listeners with proper cleanup in useEffect
- Consider input buffering to handle rapid key presses
- Direction changes should take effect on next movement tick
- Follow React best practices for event handling

## Testing

- [ ] Test all four directions with arrow keys
- [ ] Test all four directions with WASD keys
- [ ] Verify reverse direction prevention works
- [ ] Test rapid key press handling
- [ ] Confirm direction changes are responsive
- [ ] Test edge cases (multiple rapid direction changes)
