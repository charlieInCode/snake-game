# Story 1.6: Separate Game Speed and Snake Speed - Brownfield Addition

**Status**: Complete  
**Epic**: Epic 1 - Foundational Gameplay & Core Mechanics  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Story Points**: 3

## User Story

As a **player**,  
I want **the game loop timing to be independent from snake movement speed**,  
So that **I can have smooth visual updates while controlling snake speed separately for different difficulty levels**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Game timing system (useGameLoop, useGameLogic hooks)
- Technology: React hooks, TypeScript, constants-based configuration
- Follows pattern: Configuration-driven timing through constants.ts
- Touch points: GAME_CONFIG constants, game loop logic, snake movement logic, UI display components

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Game loop runs at consistent high frequency (e.g., 60 FPS) for smooth visual updates
2. Snake movement occurs at separately configurable intervals independent of game loop frequency
3. Input debouncing automatically adjusts based on snake speed, not game loop speed

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Existing game loop functionality continues to work unchanged
5. New timing configuration follows existing constants.ts pattern
6. Integration with useGameLoop and useGameLogic maintains current behavior

**Quality Requirements:**

7. Change is covered by appropriate tests
8. UI displays both game loop and snake speed information clearly
9. No regression in existing input handling or game mechanics verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Add SNAKE_SPEED constant separate from GAME_SPEED, implement tick counting logic in game loop to determine when snake should move
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Follow constants.ts configuration pattern with calculated getters for dependent values (like INPUT_CONFIG)
- **Key Constraints**: Must maintain existing input debouncing behavior relative to snake speed, preserve all current game mechanics

## Definition of Done

- [ ] SNAKE_SPEED constant added to constants.ts separate from GAME_SPEED
- [ ] Game loop runs at high frequency (GAME_SPEED) for smooth visuals
- [ ] Snake movement logic respects SNAKE_SPEED timing independent of game loop
- [ ] Input debouncing calculations use SNAKE_SPEED instead of GAME_SPEED
- [ ] UI displays both timing values clearly for transparency
- [ ] All existing functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)

## Tasks

- [x] Add SNAKE_SPEED configuration to constants.ts
- [x] Implement tick counting logic in useGameLoop to track snake movement timing
- [x] Update useGameLogic to move snake based on SNAKE_SPEED intervals
- [x] Update INPUT_CONFIG calculations to use SNAKE_SPEED for debouncing
- [x] Update UI components to display both game loop and snake speed information
- [x] Add comprehensive tests for timing separation
- [x] Verify all existing functionality works unchanged

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk**: Timing logic changes could affect game feel or introduce visual stuttering
- **Mitigation**: Implement with conservative defaults (maintain current feel), thorough testing of timing logic
- **Rollback**: Simple revert to single GAME_SPEED configuration if issues arise

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing timing APIs
- [ ] Game state changes are purely additive (new timing logic)
- [ ] UI changes follow existing information display patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible (simple tick counting logic)

## Dev Notes

- Game loop should run at ~60 FPS (16.67ms intervals) for smooth visuals
- Snake speed should default to current game feel (150ms) for consistency
- Consider tick-based approach: if (tickCount % snakeMovementInterval === 0) moveSnake()
- Input debouncing must remain responsive to snake speed for good UX
- UI should clearly distinguish between visual refresh rate and gameplay speed
