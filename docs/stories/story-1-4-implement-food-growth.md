# Story 1.4: Implement Food and Snake Growth

**Status**: Complete  
**Epic**: Epic 1 - Foundational Gameplay & Core Mechanics  
**Priority**: High  
**Story Points**: 5

## Story

**As a** player,  
**I want** the snake to eat food and grow longer,  
**so that** the core game mechanic and challenge is in place.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A single piece of food is rendered at a random, valid position on the canvas.
2. When the snake's head segment collides with the food, the snake's length increases by one segment.
3. After the food is consumed, a new piece of food appears at a new random, valid position.
4. The new food does not appear on a grid cell currently occupied by the snake.

## Tasks

- [x] Create food data structure and rendering
- [x] Implement collision detection system
- [x] Add snake growth mechanics
- [x] Create food spawning logic
- [x] Integrate food system with game loop

## Subtasks

- [x] Add food types to `types/game.ts`
- [x] Create food rendering in `GameBoard.tsx`
- [x] Implement collision detection in `lib/game-utils.ts`
- [x] Update `useGameLogic.ts` to handle food consumption
- [x] Add food spawning utilities in `lib/game-utils.ts`
- [x] Create food visual styling and colors
- [x] Add snake growth animation/visual feedback

## Dev Notes

- Food should be visually distinct from snake segments
- Collision detection should be precise (head-to-food)
- Food spawning should avoid snake body positions
- Snake growth should add segment to tail end
- Consider visual feedback when food is consumed
- Food should have consistent visual appearance

## Testing

- [x] Verify food renders correctly on canvas
- [x] Test collision detection accuracy
- [x] Confirm snake grows when eating food
- [x] Validate food spawning avoids snake body
- [x] Test multiple food consumptions
- [x] Verify food positioning is random but valid

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Quality: Excellent**

The implementation demonstrates solid senior-level architecture with clean separation of concerns. The developer successfully implemented all food and snake growth mechanics with precise collision detection, proper state management, and excellent type safety. Code follows React best practices with proper use of hooks, immutable state updates, and performance optimization through useCallback.

**Architectural Strengths:**
- Clean separation between data (types), logic (game-utils), state management (useGameLogic), and presentation (GameBoard)
- Proper use of TypeScript for type safety
- Immutable state updates following React patterns
- Excellent edge case handling (infinite loop prevention in food spawning)

### Refactoring Performed

**Enhanced Maintainability & Constants Management:**

- **File**: `src/lib/constants.ts`
  - **Change**: Added GAME_COLORS and GAME_DIMENSIONS constants
  - **Why**: Eliminates magic numbers and hard-coded colors throughout codebase
  - **How**: Centralizes configuration for easier maintenance and consistent theming

- **File**: `src/components/game/GameBoard.tsx`
  - **Change**: Replaced all hard-coded colors and dimensions with constants
  - **Why**: Improves maintainability and makes theming/styling changes easier
  - **How**: Uses imported constants instead of inline hex values and magic numbers

- **File**: `src/hooks/useGameLogic.ts`
  - **Change**: Used SCORE_CONFIG constants for scoring logic
  - **Why**: Maintains consistency with centralized configuration approach
  - **How**: Replaced magic numbers with semantic constant references

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Excellent adherence to TypeScript and React patterns
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Perfect file organization following Next.js 14+ conventions
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ Comprehensive test coverage (107 tests passing)
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ All acceptance criteria fully implemented with high quality

### Improvements Checklist

**All Items Completed During Review:**

- [x] Extracted hard-coded colors to centralized constants (constants.ts)
- [x] Replaced magic numbers with semantic constants (GameBoard.tsx)
- [x] Centralized scoring configuration (useGameLogic.ts)
- [x] Improved code readability through consistent constant usage
- [x] Enhanced maintainability through better separation of concerns

### Security Review

**No Security Concerns Identified**
- Input validation properly implemented for direction changes
- No user data persistence or external API calls
- Canvas rendering uses safe, validated coordinate calculations
- Debouncing prevents input spam/DOS attacks

### Performance Considerations

**Excellent Performance Implementation**
- Input debouncing (30ms) prevents excessive event handling
- Efficient collision detection with O(n) complexity for snake body
- Canvas rendering optimized with proper padding calculations
- State updates use proper React optimization patterns (useCallback)
- Food spawning includes intelligent maxAttempts to prevent infinite loops

**Additional Performance Notes:**
- Canvas operations are batched effectively
- No unnecessary re-renders due to proper dependency arrays
- Memory efficient with immutable state patterns

### Final Status

**✓ Approved - Ready for Done**

**Outstanding Implementation Quality:** This story demonstrates exemplary code quality with clean architecture, comprehensive testing, and thoughtful edge case handling. The implementation goes beyond basic requirements with intelligent input debouncing, robust error prevention, and excellent separation of concerns. All refactoring improvements have been applied to enhance maintainability. Code is production-ready.
