# Story 1.2: Implement the Snake

**Status**: Complete  
**Epic**: Epic 1 - Foundational Gameplay & Core Mechanics  
**Priority**: High  
**Story Points**: 5

## Story

**As a** player,  
**I want** to see a snake on the game board that moves automatically,  
**so that** the primary game character is present and functional.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A snake, composed of one or more segments, is rendered on the canvas at a starting position.
2. The snake moves automatically in a single direction (e.g., right) at a constant speed, one grid cell at a time.
3. The snake's position is correctly updated within the game's state on each movement tick.

## Tasks

- [x] Create snake data structure and types
- [x] Implement snake rendering on canvas
- [x] Add snake movement logic
- [x] Integrate snake with game loop
- [x] Create snake state management

## Subtasks

- [x] Create `types/game.ts` with snake-related types
- [x] Create `hooks/useGameLogic.ts` for snake state management
- [x] Implement snake rendering in `GameBoard.tsx`
- [x] Add movement calculation utilities in `lib/game-utils.ts`
- [x] Update game loop to handle snake movement
- [x] Add snake visual styling and colors

## Dev Notes

- Snake should start with 3-4 segments in the center of the grid
- Initial direction should be right (east)
- Movement should be grid-based, not pixel-based
- Snake segments should be visually distinct (different colors for head/body)
- State should be immutable - create new state objects for updates
- Follow the coding standards: all game logic in `useGameLogic` hook

## Testing

- [x] Verify snake renders correctly on canvas
- [x] Test snake movement in all four directions
- [x] Confirm snake state updates properly
- [x] Validate snake visual appearance
- [x] Test snake boundary handling

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-28
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates excellent software engineering practices with a well-architected, type-safe solution that follows React best practices. The snake game foundation is solid and extensible, with comprehensive test coverage and proper separation of concerns.

**Strengths:**
- Clean, modular architecture with proper separation of concerns
- Comprehensive TypeScript coverage providing excellent type safety
- Immutable state management following React best practices
- Extensive test coverage with 116 passing tests across all modules
- Performance-optimized game loop with separate visual and gameplay timing
- Well-structured utility functions with clear responsibilities

### Refactoring Performed

**File**: `/src/hooks/useGameLogic.ts`
- **Change**: Removed unused `GameScreenState` import
- **Why**: Cleaning up unused imports improves code maintainability and reduces bundle size
- **How**: Removed the unused type import while preserving all functionality

**File**: `/src/app/page.tsx` 
- **Change**: Removed unused `getIsGameOver` variable and `event` parameter
- **Why**: Eliminating dead code improves readability and removes linting warnings
- **How**: Cleaned up unused variables while maintaining all game functionality

**File**: `/src/hooks/useGameLoop.ts`
- **Change**: Fixed React Hook dependency array warning
- **Why**: Ensures React hooks follow exhaustive dependencies rule for optimal performance
- **How**: Added missing dependencies to useCallback dependency array

**File**: Test files cleanup
- **Change**: Removed unused imports and variables across test files
- **Why**: Maintains clean test code and removes linting noise
- **How**: Cleaned up unused imports in GameBoard.test.tsx, useGameLoop.test.ts, and game-utils.test.ts

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ All game logic properly contained in `useGameLogic` hook
- Project Structure: ✓ Files organized according to Next.js App Router conventions
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit and integration test coverage (116 tests passing)
- All ACs Met: ✓ Snake renders, moves automatically, and updates state correctly

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Cleaned up unused imports and variables across all files
- [x] Fixed React Hook dependencies warning in useGameLoop
- [x] Verified all 116 tests pass after cleanup
- [x] Confirmed linting warnings reduced from 9 to 0
- [x] Validated game functionality remains intact after refactoring
- [ ] Consider adding JSDoc comments for complex game logic functions
- [ ] Consider extracting game constants to make them more configurable

### Security Review
No security concerns identified. The implementation:
- Uses React's built-in XSS protection through JSX
- Avoids `eval()` or other dangerous JavaScript patterns
- Properly validates input directions to prevent invalid moves
- Uses TypeScript for compile-time type safety

### Performance Considerations
Excellent performance implementation:
- Efficient game loop with separate visual (16ms) and snake movement (150ms) timing
- Canvas rendering optimized with minimal redraws
- Immutable state updates prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Input debouncing prevents rapid-fire direction changes
- Wall wrapping algorithm is O(1) complexity

### Final Status
✓ **Approved - Ready for Done**

All acceptance criteria met with high-quality implementation. The snake game foundation provides excellent architecture for future features like food consumption, scoring, and collision detection. Code quality exceeds expectations with comprehensive testing and clean, maintainable code structure.
