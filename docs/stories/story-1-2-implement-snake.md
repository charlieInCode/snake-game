# Story 1.2: Implement the Snake

**Status**: Ready for Review  
**Epic**: Epic 1 - Foundational Gameplay & Core Mechanics  
**Priority**: High  
**Story Points**: 5

## Story

**As a** player,  
**I want** to see a snake on the game board that moves automatically,  
**so that** the primary game character is present and functional.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A snake, composed of one or more segments, is rendered on the canvas at a starting position.
2. The snake moves automatically in a single direction (e.g., right) at a constant speed, one grid cell at a time.
3. The snake's position is correctly updated within the game's state on each movement tick.

## Tasks

- [x] Create snake data structure and types
- [x] Implement snake rendering on canvas
- [x] Add snake movement logic
- [x] Integrate snake with game loop
- [x] Create snake state management

## Subtasks

- [x] Create `types/game.ts` with snake-related types
- [x] Create `hooks/useGameLogic.ts` for snake state management
- [x] Implement snake rendering in `GameBoard.tsx`
- [x] Add movement calculation utilities in `lib/game-utils.ts`
- [x] Update game loop to handle snake movement
- [x] Add snake visual styling and colors

## Dev Notes

- Snake should start with 3-4 segments in the center of the grid
- Initial direction should be right (east)
- Movement should be grid-based, not pixel-based
- Snake segments should be visually distinct (different colors for head/body)
- State should be immutable - create new state objects for updates
- Follow the coding standards: all game logic in `useGameLogic` hook

## Testing

- [x] Verify snake renders correctly on canvas
- [x] Test snake movement in all four directions
- [x] Confirm snake state updates properly
- [x] Validate snake visual appearance
- [x] Test snake boundary handling

## QA Results

### QA Review Summary ✅ **PASSED**
**Reviewed by**: Quinn (QA Engineer)  
**Review Date**: Current Session  
**Status**: All acceptance criteria met with excellent implementation quality

### Implementation Quality Assessment

**✅ Acceptance Criteria Verification:**
1. ✅ Snake with multiple segments renders correctly - 3 segments with distinct head/body colors
2. ✅ Snake moves automatically in single direction (right) - Smooth movement verified
3. ✅ Snake position updates correctly in game state - State management working properly

**✅ Code Quality Assessment:**
- **Architecture**: Excellent separation of concerns with dedicated game logic hook
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript types for all game entities
- **State Management**: Immutable state updates following React best practices
- **Visual Design**: Clear visual distinction between head (emerald-500) and body (emerald-600)
- **Performance**: Efficient rendering with no performance issues

**✅ Technical Implementation:**
- `useGameLogic.ts` properly centralizes all game logic as specified
- Snake data structures are well-designed and extensible
- Movement utilities are pure functions with clear responsibilities
- Boundary collision detection is implemented and working
- Game over state properly handled
- Canvas rendering optimized with proper color coding

**✅ Code Standards Compliance:**
- ✅ All game logic contained in `useGameLogic` hook as required
- ✅ Immutable state updates throughout
- ✅ Grid-based movement (not pixel-based) correctly implemented
- ✅ Visual distinction between snake segments implemented
- ✅ TypeScript compilation without warnings

**✅ Testing Verification:**
- ✅ Snake renders correctly with proper colors and positioning
- ✅ Movement calculation works in all directions
- ✅ State updates are immediate and accurate
- ✅ Boundary collision detection prevents out-of-bounds movement
- ✅ Game over logic activates correctly

**Notable Strengths:**
- Clean, extensible architecture ready for future features
- Excellent type safety throughout the codebase
- Proper React patterns and hooks usage
- Well-structured utility functions for game calculations

**Overall Assessment**: High-quality implementation that exceeds expectations with excellent architecture.
