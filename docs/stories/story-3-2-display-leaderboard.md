# Story 3.2: Read and Display Leaderboard

**Status**: Draft  
**Epic**: Epic 3 - Persistent Leaderboard & Final Polish  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Story Points**: 3

## Story

**As a** player,  
**I want** to see the list of high scores,  
**so that** I can see what I am aiming to beat.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. When the application first loads, it checks Local Storage for any saved high scores.
2. The retrieved high scores are displayed on the "Start Screen".
3. The updated leaderboard, including the player's most recent score if it's a new high score, is displayed on the "Game Over" screen.
4. If no scores are present in Local Storage, the leaderboard displays a default message (e.g., "No high scores yet!").

## Tasks
