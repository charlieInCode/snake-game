# Story 2.5: Progressive Difficulty Speed Enhancement

**Status**: Draft  
**Epic**: Epic 2 - Full Game Experience & Responsive UI  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Story Points**: 3

## User Story

As a **player**,
I want **the snake to move faster and grow faster after eating more food**,
So that **the game becomes progressively more challenging and exciting as my score increases**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Game speed configuration in `GAME_CONFIG`, `useGameLoop` hook for timing control, and game state management in `useGameLogic`
- Technology: React hooks, TypeScript, timing-based game loop with `requestAnimationFrame`
- Follows pattern: Existing speed configuration pattern using `GAME_CONFIG.SNAKE_SPEED` and dynamic game loop timing
- Touch points: `useGameLoop` hook for speed adjustment, `GameState` for tracking food eaten count, score calculation logic

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Snake movement speed increases incrementally based on the number of food items eaten (every 3-5 food items reduces movement interval by 10-15ms)
2. Snake growth remains at 2 segments per food but applies immediately without delay for faster-paced progression
3. Speed increases are capped at a minimum interval (e.g., 50ms) to maintain playability

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Existing game loop timing system continues to work unchanged
5. New functionality follows existing game configuration pattern in `constants.ts`
6. Integration with `useGameLoop` maintains current visual update frequency while adjusting snake movement speed

**Quality Requirements:**

7. Change is covered by appropriate tests for speed calculation and game progression
8. Documentation is updated to reflect new progressive difficulty feature
9. No regression in existing gameplay mechanics verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Add `foodEaten` counter to `GameState`, create speed calculation utility, modify `useGameLoop` to accept dynamic speed values
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow `GAME_CONFIG` constants pattern and `useGameLoop` speed parameter pattern for dynamic timing
- **Key Constraints:** Must maintain 60 FPS visual updates, speed changes should feel gradual not jarring, minimum speed limit for playability

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements met
- [ ] Integration requirements verified  
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] Documentation updated if applicable

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** Speed changes could make game unplayable or break existing timing assumptions
- **Mitigation:** Implement speed caps and gradual progression with extensive testing
- **Rollback:** Feature can be disabled by reverting to static `GAME_CONFIG.SNAKE_SPEED` value

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] Database changes (if any) are additive only - N/A for this client-side feature
- [ ] UI changes follow existing design patterns - maintains current game display
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible - minimal computational overhead for speed calculation

## Validation Checklist

**Scope Validation:**

- [ ] Story can be completed in one development session (estimated 3-4 hours)
- [ ] Integration approach is straightforward using existing game loop architecture
- [ ] Follows existing patterns exactly for configuration and timing
- [ ] No design or architecture work required - uses current game state and timing system

**Clarity Check:**

- [ ] Story requirements are unambiguous
- [ ] Integration points are clearly specified (GameState, useGameLoop, constants)
- [ ] Success criteria are testable through gameplay and unit tests
- [ ] Rollback approach is simple and feasible
