# Story 2.4: Add Mobile Touch Controls

**Status**: Draft  
**Epic**: Epic 2 - Full Game Experience & Responsive UI  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Story Points**: 4

## Story

**As a** player,  
**I want** to control the snake on my mobile device using touch,  
**so that** the game is fully playable on a touchscreen.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Swiping up, down, left, or right on the game canvas changes the snake's direction.
2. The touch controls are responsive and do not have significant input lag.
3. The snake cannot be reversed into itself via a swipe, similar to the keyboard controls.
4. Touch controls do not interfere with UI buttons outside the game canvas.

## Tasks

- [ ] Implement touch event handling
- [ ] Create swipe detection system
- [ ] Add touch-to-direction mapping
- [ ] Integrate touch controls with game logic
- [ ] Test touch responsiveness

## Subtasks

- [ ] Add touch event listeners to `GameBoard.tsx`
- [ ] Create swipe detection in `lib/game-utils.ts`
- [ ] Update `useGameLogic.ts` to handle touch input
- [ ] Add touch direction validation
- [ ] Implement touch feedback/visual indicators
- [ ] Test touch controls on mobile devices
- [ ] Add touch gesture prevention for UI elements

## Dev Notes

- Use touchstart, touchmove, touchend events
- Implement swipe detection with minimum distance threshold
- Prevent default touch behaviors that might interfere
- Consider adding visual feedback for touch gestures
- Touch controls should work alongside keyboard controls
- Test on actual mobile devices for responsiveness

## Testing

- [ ] Test swipe up/down/left/right detection
- [ ] Verify touch controls are responsive
- [ ] Confirm reverse direction prevention works
- [ ] Test touch controls don't interfere with UI
- [ ] Validate touch controls on different mobile devices
- [ ] Test touch gesture accuracy and reliability
