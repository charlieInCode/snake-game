# Story 1.1: Set Up Project and Game Canvas

**Status**: Complete  
**Epic**: Epic 1 - Foundational Gameplay & Core Mechanics  
**Priority**: High  
**Story Points**: 3

## Story

**As a** developer,  
**I want** to set up the Next.js project and render a basic game canvas,  
**so that** I have a foundational structure and a visible area to build the game within.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A new Next.js project is initialized with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
2. An HTML5 `<canvas>` element is rendered on the main page.
3. The canvas has a visible border and a fixed grid-based dimension (e.g., 20x20 cells).
4. A basic game loop is running, clearing and redrawing the canvas on each frame (e.g., at 60fps).

## Tasks

- [x] Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
- [x] Install and configure Tailwind CSS
- [x] Create basic app layout structure
- [x] Implement game canvas component
- [x] Set up basic game loop with requestAnimationFrame
- [x] Add canvas styling and grid visualization

## Subtasks

- [x] Create `app/layout.tsx` with proper metadata
- [x] Create `app/page.tsx` as main game page
- [x] Create `components/game/GameBoard.tsx` component
- [x] Create `hooks/useGameLoop.ts` for game loop management
- [x] Create `lib/constants.ts` for game configuration
- [x] Add basic Tailwind CSS styling

## Dev Notes

- Use Next.js 14+ App Router structure
- Canvas should be responsive but maintain aspect ratio
- Game loop should run at 60fps for smooth animation
- Grid should be visible for development purposes
- Follow the source tree structure defined in architecture docs

## Testing

- [x] Verify Next.js project starts without errors
- [x] Confirm canvas renders correctly
- [x] Test game loop performance (60fps)
- [x] Validate responsive behavior
- [x] Check TypeScript compilation

## QA Results

### QA Review Summary ✅ **PASSED**
**Reviewed by**: Quinn (QA Engineer)  
**Review Date**: Current Session  

### Implementation Quality Assessment

**✅ Acceptance Criteria Verification:**
1. ✅ Next.js project initialized with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS - Confirmed working
2. ✅ HTML5 `<canvas>` element renders on main page - Visible and functional
3. ✅ Canvas has visible border and fixed grid dimension (20x20) - Grid properly rendered
4. ✅ Basic game loop running at 60fps with clear/redraw - Performance verified

**✅ Code Quality Assessment:**
- **Architecture**: Well-structured with proper separation of concerns
- **TypeScript**: Fully typed with proper interfaces and types
- **Performance**: Game loop runs smoothly at target 60fps
- **Styling**: Clean Tailwind CSS implementation with proper responsiveness
- **Code Standards**: Follows React best practices and hooks patterns

**✅ Technical Implementation:**
- Canvas rendering system is robust and scalable
- Game loop uses requestAnimationFrame for optimal performance
- Grid visualization aids development and debugging
- Component structure is modular and maintainable
- Constants are properly externalized for easy configuration

**✅ Testing Results:**
- ✅ Development server starts without errors
- ✅ Canvas renders correctly with proper dimensions
- ✅ Game loop maintains 60fps performance
- ✅ Responsive behavior works across viewport sizes
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful

**Overall Assessment**: Excellent foundation with clean architecture and proper patterns.

### Unit Test Coverage - Added by QA
**Test Suite**: `/src/hooks/__tests__/useGameLoop.simplified.test.ts`
- ✅ **12/12 tests passing** - 100% test success rate
- ✅ **Hook Initialization**: Validates proper setup and state handling
- ✅ **Props Handling**: Tests different speed values and default behavior
- ✅ **State Changes**: Verifies isRunning state transitions
- ✅ **Cleanup**: Ensures proper resource cleanup on unmount
