# Story 2.3: Implement Responsive UI Layout

**Status**: Draft  
**Epic**: Epic 2 - Full Game Experience & Responsive UI  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Story Points**: 4

## Story

**As a** player,  
**I want** the game and surrounding UI to adapt to my screen size,  
**so that** I can have a great experience on either desktop or mobile.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The game canvas and UI elements (score, buttons) resize and reflow gracefully for common mobile, tablet, and desktop screen widths.
2. The layout is visually appealing and functional on a small mobile viewport (e.g., 375px width).
3. The layout does not break or become unusable on large desktop screens.
4. Tailwind CSS's responsive design features (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) are used to achieve responsiveness.
