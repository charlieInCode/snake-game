# Story 2.1: Implement Game State Screens

**Status**: Complete  
**Epic**: Epic 2 - Full Game Experience & Responsive UI  
**Priority**: High  
**Story Points**: 5

## Story

**As a** player,  
**I want** to see clear start and game-over screens,  
**so that** I have a complete and understandable game loop from beginning to end.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A "Start Screen" is displayed before the game begins, showing the game title and a "Start Game" button.
2. A "Game Over" screen (or modal) is displayed when the snake collides with a wall or itself.
3. The "Game Over" screen displays the player's final score.
4. The "Game Over" screen includes a "Restart" button.
5. These screens are built using reusable Shadcn UI components where appropriate (e.g., Button, Card).

## Tasks

- [x] Create game state management system
- [x] Implement start screen component
- [x] Implement game over screen component
- [x] Add collision detection for game over
- [x] Integrate screens with game flow

## Subtasks

- [x] Add game state types to `types/game.ts`
- [x] Create `components/game/StartScreen.tsx`
- [x] Create `components/game/GameOverScreen.tsx`
- [x] Update `useGameLogic.ts` to handle game states
- [x] Add collision detection for walls and self
- [x] Integrate Shadcn UI components (Button, Card)
- [x] Add screen transitions and animations

## Dev Notes

- Game states: 'start', 'playing', 'paused', 'game-over'
- Use Shadcn UI components for consistent styling
- Screens should be responsive and centered
- Consider adding game title and branding
- Game over should show final score prominently
- Follow the coding standards for component structure

## Testing

- [x] Verify start screen displays correctly
- [x] Test start button functionality
- [x] Confirm game over screen shows on collision
- [x] Validate restart button works
- [x] Test screen responsiveness
- [x] Verify Shadcn UI components render properly

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-28
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
The implementation demonstrates excellent code quality with proper separation of concerns, immutable state management, and comprehensive testing coverage. The developer successfully implemented all acceptance criteria with proper TypeScript typing, React hooks patterns, and Shadcn UI integration. The game state management system is well-architected and the screen components follow established UI patterns.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: src/components/game/GameOverScreen.tsx
  - **Change**: Updated button text from "Play Again" to "Restart Game"
  - **Why**: Better consistency with the acceptance criteria requirement for a "Restart" button
  - **How**: Improved semantic clarity and user expectation alignment

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows all critical rules - state logic in hooks, Shadcn UI components, immutable state
- Project Structure: ✓ Components properly placed in game directory, proper naming conventions
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive test coverage (116/116 tests passing) with proper mocking and edge cases
- All ACs Met: ✓ All acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested

**AC1**: ✓ Start Screen displays with game title and start button
**AC2**: ✓ Game Over screen shows on collision (self-collision properly detected)
**AC3**: ✓ Final score displayed prominently on Game Over screen
**AC4**: ✓ Restart button implemented with proper functionality
**AC5**: ✓ Shadcn UI Button and Card components properly integrated

### Improvements Checklist
All items were already properly implemented by the developer:

- [x] Game state management system properly implemented (useGameLogic.ts)
- [x] Start screen with responsive design and Shadcn UI components
- [x] Game over screen with score display and restart functionality
- [x] Proper collision detection for game over trigger
- [x] Screen transitions and conditional rendering
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage for all scenarios
- [x] Proper TypeScript interfaces and type safety
- [x] Keyboard event handling for restart functionality

### Security Review
No security concerns identified. The implementation uses standard React patterns with proper event handling and state management. No external data sources or user inputs that could pose security risks.

### Performance Considerations
The implementation is performant with proper use of React.useCallback for event handlers, efficient state updates, and minimal re-renders. The game state management follows React best practices for performance optimization.

### Final Status
✓ Approved - Ready for Done

**Rationale**: All acceptance criteria are fully met with excellent code quality, comprehensive testing, and proper adherence to project standards. The implementation demonstrates senior-level React development practices with proper separation of concerns, type safety, and user experience considerations.
